# YTAnalyzer
Development of an AI-based tool for analyzing YouTube comments.
The tool uses natural language processing (NLP) to automatically classify comments into sentiment categories (positive, neutral, negative), emotions (e.g., joy, anger, sadness), intentions (e.g., feedback, question, recommendation), and topics.
The goal is to gain aggregated insights into user opinions, trends, and content focus areas that can be used for research, content strategies, and marketing.
